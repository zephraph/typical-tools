# Typical Tools

A quick project to implement an LSP for [Typical](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical)'s DSL using [Langium](https://langium.org/).

## Context

I built this at [Recurse](https://recurse.com) partly as a learning project, partly because I wanted to use Typical and I wanted some tooling for it. [Read my post](https://just-be.dev/rc/typical-lsp) to learn more.
